# :open_file_folder: Air Quality Index Prediction

This repository contains code to predict the air quality based on the given parameters. With this project, users can detect air quality and decide whether to go outside.

## :memo: Description

This project aims to build a predictive model for air quality to monitor, evaluate, and investigate variations. The goal is to generate alarms for harmful gas emissions, providing guidelines for industries and the public to mitigate health impacts. A web app has been created for users to predict Air Quality with some or all parameters. An **Explore** page is included where developers and students can explore graphs and charts to identify relationships between parameters or gain domain knowledge. Even casual users can enjoy the **Explore** page and have fun! :smiley:

## :gear: Project Demo

- The application is hosted on Render. Check out the [demo](https://aqi-prediction-h0pz.onrender.com).
